I will write a ruby program using fx ruby window  to display a light that shines while internet is working, and a different color when things are not working. Will alternate icon(light) using a boolean return from a method that pings a backend using an http get request. Method is an if else, which returns a false if ping returns  “ “ or nill, or not defined; returns true if else.

FXRuby main window attributes
Small rectangle, either horizontal or vertical, about 200x400 or smaller
Small icon to exit(x);
DECOR_NONE
If press on icon, turns test off.


Logic attributes
Import necessary dependencies
